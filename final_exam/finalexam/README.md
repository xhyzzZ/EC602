The computer exam has three parts:

cleanresearch 
palindromicanagram 
hiddenmessage 

Each problem will be valued at between 20% of
your grade and 40% of your grade. I will choose
the value to maximize your result. You must solve
two of them, but you do not have to solve all three
unless you think it improves your chances.


Each problem has a supporting input file or files
to test your program with:

cr_data.txt
pa_data.txt
hm_data.txt, cat_msg.txt
