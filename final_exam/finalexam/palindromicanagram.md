# Problem A: Palindromic Anagram (40%)

This problem is to discover the "palindromic anagram groups"
in a wordlist contained in a file.

An anagram group is the collection of all words in the wordlist
that are anagrams of each other. An anagram is a word with the 
same letters as another word but re-arranged. The number of 
words in an anagram group must be more than one.

So "cat" and "act" are anagrams, as are "truster" and "turrets"

A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same forwards and backward.

So, "tot" and "rotator" are each palindromes.


## Program Specifications.

The program should be called palindromicanagram and accept the
name of a wordlist on the command line.
The output should be all the palindromic anagram groups,
one group per line. The output will be printed to stdout.
